# Overview
This repository contains my work from the College Board's AP Research course in the 2020â€“21 academic year. As well, it has the start of some revitalization efforts I've begun because I don't quite think I had the technical skills to go as far as I could have with this project.

I am not expecting to maintain any of the Java code here as it is present mostly for reference, but a rewrite in Rust is pending.
